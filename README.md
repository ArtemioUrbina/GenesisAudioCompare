# MDFourier

MDFourier is an open source software solution created to compare audio signa-
tures and generate a series of graphs that show how they dier. The software
consists of two separate programs, one that produces the signal for recording
from the console and the other that analyses and displays the audio comparisons.

The information gathered from the comparison results can be used in a
variety of ways: to identify how audio signatures vary between systems, to detect
if the audio signals are modied by audio equipment, to nd if modications
resulted in audible changes, to help tune emulators, FPGA implementations or
mods, etc.
