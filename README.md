# MDFourier
A Fourier Transform analysis tool to compare different Sega Genesis/Mega Drive audio hardware revisions. 

This is a set of tools intended to compare Mega Drive/Sega Genesis audio characteristics aided by Fourier analysis. 

# Objective

Provide a data analysis framework to compare audio generated by any MegaDrive/Genesis variant, clone or implementation.
With these tools, any implementation can be evaluated against the frequency response of any other in order to compare how similar they are. As a result, they can also be fine tuned to closely resemble the desired result since any reference audio file generated with the 240p Test Suite can be used to compare it to any other. 

The intention is not to detriment any particular implementation, but help to improve them whenever possible by identifying the differences. This can help emulators, FPGA implementations and even hardware modifications to match the desired reference recording.
Although I believe any present and future implementation should base its characteristics on vintage retail hardware, that doesnâ€™t mean there is room for improvement. Reducing noise is one such area.

The YM2612 operates just like the YM3812 does, in that it has an internal log transformed table. Modern implementations like MAME, the MAME derived core in Genesis Plus GX, Nuked, BlastEm and Exodus should all have bit perfect recreations of the tables used in the original chip. However there are differences that must come from the analog side. If it can be done with complete accuracy, why aren't we doing it? I believe lack of information is one of the answers to that question.

I must emphasize I am not an expert in any of the related areas, just interested in preservation and FM sound. Any corrections and improvements are encouraged and welcome.
